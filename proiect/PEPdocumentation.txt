Abstract
========

4InARow is a two-player game played either between humans or between a human and an AI opponent with three difficulty levels.
The game allows players to choose the table dimensions and decide which player makes the first move.
This project serves as a computer science faculty assignment, aiming to teach the concepts of the 4InARow game.

Motivation
==========

The primary motivation behind this project is to provide an educational tool for learning about the 4InARow game.
The game is designed to be a fun and simple experience, serving as a relaxing and engaging activity.

Goals
=====

The goals of the project include:
- Implementing a functional 4InARow game.
- Supporting two-player mode and player-AI mode with adjustable difficulty levels.
- Allowing customization of the game board dimensions.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for a seamless gaming experience.

Scope
=====

The scope of this project covers the implementation of the 4InARow game, including user interaction, game mechanics, and AI behavior.
It does not encompass advanced features beyond the core functionality of the game.

Impact
======

The game is intended to have a positive impact on learners, providing an interactive way to understand the principles of the 4InARow game.
Its simplicity and user-friendly design aim to make it an enjoyable and educational experience.

Summary of Key Points
=====================

- 4InARow is a two-player game with optional AI opponents.
- Adjustable difficulty levels for AI opponents.
- Customizable game board dimensions.
- Educational tool for learning about the 4InARow game.
- Created as a computer science faculty assignment.
- Designed for relaxation and enjoyment.

Specification
==============

1. **Graphical User Interface:**
   - A graphical user interface (GUI) will be created to provide users with the ability to play a game of 4InARow.
   The GUI will facilitate interaction and visualization of the game state.

2. **Player Options:**
   - The game will support two-player mode, allowing users to play against each other.
   - Additionally, the game will feature a mode where users can play against the computer AI.

3. **AI Difficulty Levels:**
   - The computer opponent (AI) will have three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and advanced.
   - Each difficulty level will offer varying levels of challenge and strategic play.

4. **Initialization Parameters:**
   - During initialization, users will be able to set the dimensions of the game board.
   - Users will also be able to choose whether the computer or a human player makes the first move when playing against an AI opponent.

5. **Game Initialization:**
   - The game will be initialized with the specified parameters, including the chosen board dimensions and the starting player (computer or human).


Implementation
===============

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - The GUI is developed using the pygame library, providing a cross-platform interface for the 4InARow game.
   - Visual elements will include a game board and player indicators.

2. **Game Board Representation:**
   - The game board will be represented as a matrix to track the placement of discs.
   - Each player's moves will be recorded on the board during the game.

3. **Player and AI Logic:**
   - Player turns will be handled through event listeners on GUI buttons.
   - AI opponents will utilize distinct algorithms for each difficulty level:
     -Easy Strategy: The easy_strategy function selects a random column for the AI player to drop a disc. It keeps trying until a valid move is made.
     -Medium Strategy: The medium_strategy function first checks for a winning move. If none is found, it then checks for a blocking move against the opponent. If still no move is found, it calls find_strategic_move_medium to determine a strategic move based on additional logic.
     -Hard Strategy: The hard_strategy function follows a similar approach as the medium strategy but includes additional checks. It also calls find_strategic_move_hard to determine a strategic move based on harder difficulty level logic.

4. **Initialization Parameters:**
   - During the initialization phase, users will be prompted to set the board dimensions and choose the starting player (human or AI).

5. **Game Loop:**
   - The game will operate within a continuous loop, allowing players to make moves until a win or draw condition is met.

6. **Game Over Conditions:**
   - The game will check for win or draw conditions after each move, triggering appropriate actions and informing the players of the result.

7. **User Interface Feedback:**
   - The GUI will provide real-time relevant messages to players (e.g., win).

8. **Educational Elements:**
   - Visual cues in the GUI will emphasize game strategy and educate users about the 4InARow rules.

9. **Testing Plan:**
   - The implementation will undergo and user testing for overall usability.
